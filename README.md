# Bungalow Take Home Project for Data Engineer Role (V1. 2021-06-29)

Welcome to the Bungalow Takehome Challenge for Data Engineering! This is a barebones repo to get you started.

## What to build

A common task for data engineers at Bungalow involves the handling of raw data, modelling data, storing it and making it available for downstream
teams such as analytics, data science and ultimately the entire organization.

For this challenge we'd like to give a brief snapshot of a common workload may entail.

With the sample data in `sample-data/data.csv` we would like you to:

1. Create a script to process and clean the data
2. Ingest the data into a relational database of your choice, considering relationships, integrity, performance, and extendability
3. Write a SQL query, or python script, of your choice, computing something you find interesting on top of the data, store this in a file `query.sql` (or `query.py`)

This project is meant to be flexible as to showcase your decision making capabilities and your overall technical experience.
As long as you can achieve the outcome feel free to use any additional tooling and approach you see fit - we just ask that you use Python üêç for
the scripting and a SQL database as your data store (e.g SQLite, or Docker + Postgres as an example)

We are more interested in seeing your thought process and approach to solving the problem!

## Evaluation

We will use this project as our basis for our evaluation of your overall fit for a data engineering role from a technical viewpoint.

To do this, we will review your code with an eye for the following:

- Readability and usability
- Data processing and relational modelling
- Python and SQL know-how

## Time expectations

We know you are busy and likely have other commitments in your life, so we don't want to take too much of your time.
We don't expect you to spend more than **2 hours** working on this project. That being said, if you choose to put more or
less time into it for whatever reason, that is your choice.

Feel free to indicate in your notes below if you worked on this for a different amount of time and we will keep that
in mind while evaluating the project. You can also provide us with additional context if you would like to.

Additionally, we have left a spot below for you to note. If you have ideas for pieces that you would have done differently
or additional things you would have implemented if you had more time, you can indicate those in your notes below as well,
and we will use those as part of the evaluation.

## Public forks

We encourage you to try this project without looking at the solutions others may have posted. This will give the most
honest representation of your abilities and skills. However, we also recognize that day-to-day programming often involves
looking at solutions others have provided and iterating on them. Being able to pick out the best parts and truly
understand them well enough to make good choices about what to copy and what to pass on by is a skill in and of itself.
As such, if you do end up referencing someone else's work and building upon it, we ask that you note that as a comment.
Provide a link to the source so we can see the original work and any modifications that you chose to make.

## Challenge instructions

1. Fork this repository and clone to your local environment
1. Prepare your environment with Python and any other tools you may need
1. Complete the challenge and push back to the repo
